Lawnchair.php is a port of PHP port of Lawnchair.js

See <a href="http://westcoastlogic.com/lawnchair/">here</a> for the original javascript library.



I mostly made this for something to try, and have tested with over 20,000 records in a table and had it work fast.

You have a choice of adapters, it can store it as text files or in a mySQL database, and you can build on that.

I'll do more documentation as I go..

This also works really nicely with underscore.php
